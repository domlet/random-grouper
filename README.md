# random-grouper app

## What did I build?

[**random-grouper**](https://domlet.github.io/random-grouper) is a simple web app that plays noisy sounds while it generates small groups (any number) by randomly selecting names from a roster. 

Anyone can download it and use it with their own groups (without publishing PII such as student names on the Internet) by following [these steps](https://domlet.github.io/random-grouper)!

## What problem am I solving?

In my experience, it is not uncommon for students to hate being placed in random groups. Yet, it is beneficial for students to learn and practive collaboration skills that work with unfamiliar people.

## How does it work?

This app alleviates hatred by playing sound effects and adding suspense to the process. 

## How can I use it?
